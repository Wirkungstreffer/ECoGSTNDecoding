# ECoGSTNDecoding
Monitoring deep brain activity is crucial for understanding neural circuit dysfunction and advancing neuromodulation therapies. Here in this repository, we implemented a set of machine learning algorithms combining spectral processing and diffusion models to decode subthalamic nucleus activity from cortical signals.

This project aims to extract relevant information or features of STN (subthalamic nucleus) data using ECoG (electrocorticography) recordings. The extracted features can serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers or aid in treatment strategies.
