# ECoGSTNDecoding
Monitoring deep brain activity is crucial for understanding neural circuit dysfunction and advancing neuromodulation therapies. Here in this repository, we implemented a set of machine learning algorithms combining spectral processing and diffusion models to decode subthalamic nucleus activity from cortical signals.

We establish broad clinical utility through successful generalization across disease conditions (Parkinson's disease, dystonia, Tourette syndrome), subcortical targets (subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, centromedian thalamus), and behavioral states, while maintaining efficacy during stimulation artifacts and movement.
